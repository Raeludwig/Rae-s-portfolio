      Hi! I am Rae. I am artist, turned librarian, turned web developer. Oddly enough I think that is a great combination of things. I have learned that aestetics and research are very important when it comes to coding. I am new to the coding world, in 2022 I had an issue with a program at work and accidentally ended up fixing the code to solve the problem (which is when I realized that coding is just MySpace! I hadn't actually realized that until that moment). I am currently enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp through the UC San Diego and am excited to see where this journey takes me!
